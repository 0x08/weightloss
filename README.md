# Ben's open-source guide to a healthier life

Over the past three years I have been tackling excess weight and have been trying to live a healthier life. To achieve this I came up with a weight loss plan and I have added regular exercise to my weekly routine.

This document is an attempt to put together the things that I have learnt over the past few years. It is intended to be a document for both myself to reflect on whenever the going gets tough, but I also hope that it might help other people achieve their goals.

The items below do not have to be read in any particular order, they are all important points in your long-term goals towards a healthier and happier life.

## You are in it for the long haul.

During my lifetime I have often been on a diet in order to lose weight. Very often these goals were rather short-sighted and lacked any long-term vision or goals. After losing a certain amount of weight, the scales would slowly creep upwards again and after a few years I would be back in the same place as I was previously.

Make a commitment to yourself: you are in it for the (very) long haul. It will not always be straightforward and it will take some time, but you *will* get there in the end if you are committed.

Do not fool yourself, building a new lifestyle is hard but the results are worth it: **a longer, healthier and happier life to do the things you enjoy with the people you love**.

## Know your basal metabolic rate.

Your basal metabolic rate (BMR) defines how many calories your body consumes on a daily basis in order to *stay alive*. This excludes any walking, moving, etc. that you would do in a normal day. The point here is to know what your body would consume if you would not do anything at all for twenty-four hours.

There are enough websites out there that allow you to calculate your BMR. If you want to calculate it yourself, the formulas are:

* For males it is = `66.47 + (13.75 * weight in kg) + (5.003 * height in cm) - (6.755 * age in years)`
* For females it is `655.1 + (9.563 * weight in kg) + (1.85 * height in cm) âˆ’ (4.676 * age in years)`

Once you have calculated your BMR, you should then multiply it with an activity modifier which depends on your physical activity level:

* Little/no exercise: `1.2`
* Light exercise: `1.375`
* Moderate exercise (3-5 days per week): `1.55`
* Very active (6-7 days per week): `1.725`
* Extra active (6-7 days per week and a physical job): `1.9`

This will then give you the average number of kcals that your body will consume per day. As I am writing this I am 199cm, 114kgs and 44 years old, meaning that my BMR is 2994 kcals with an activity modifier of 1.55:

```
(66.47 + (13.75 * 114) + (5.003 * 119) - (6.755 * 44)) * 1.55 = 2994
```

## Know what you are eating.

Food! Glorious food.. one of the prime reasons for living. Even when you are restricting your calorie intake, there is no reason why you should not be able to enjoy your favourite foods, albeit in moderation. The most important point is to **know what you are eating**. You need to know what the calorie content is of the food you eating. Make a plan so you know what you are consuming every 24 hours.

## Track your movement.

This is obviously not a must but it helped me a lot. For Christmas in 2020 I got a Fitbit movement tracker that allows me to track my daily steps, my runs and the amount of calories I burn in a day. My daily movement target is 10,000 steps. I am pretty sure that my Fitbit is not very precise but that does not matter: even if it is off by a few thousand steps it still allows you to compare one day to another.

## Track your weight.

Make sure to keep track of your weight. It doesn't make sense to weigh yourself every day, once a week is fine.

## Choose a form of exercise that you enjoy and plan for it.

The human body is made to move. Millions of years of evolution have built an amazing machine that is fine-tuned to move. This might not seem so right now but I promise that it is!

Find a form of exercise that you enjoy and that you can commit to doing 2-3 times a week. Personally I have become a big fan of running due to the fact that I can easily slip on my running shoes and step out the door.

Don't forget that simply going for a good hour-long walk three times a week is probably more than enough to get you started!

## r = (e - b)

Your weight loss result (r) is defined by what you eat (e) minus what you burn (b). **This is the only formula that matters.** Whatever any other weight-loss plans say, this is the only piece of information you need to take into account when eating and exercising.

## Treat yourself.

Every day I plan 200 kcals of "treats" into my daily intake. This can then be anything you like: I have some chocolate or something else I really enjoy. By treating yourself at regular intervals you will be able to maintain your plan for a much longer period of time.

## Continuous improvement, make small adjustments.

Keep evaluating what you are doing: every now and again look at your plan and critically evaluate it for yourself: where can adjustments be made? How can we improve it to reach your goals?
